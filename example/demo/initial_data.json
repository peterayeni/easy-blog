This is reposted below:</p>\r\n<p>Ragavan Srinivasan's <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2012/02/22/mozilla-marketplace-opening-for-app-submissions-soon/\">post about the forthcoming Mozilla Marketplace</a> for <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apps.mozillalabs.com/\">Open Web Apps</a> inspired me to write about Mozilla's surging Web and Device API standards work.</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"250\" alt=\"\" src=\"/media/cache/09/6b/096b4582c8f75d771110ea6883afd22d.png\" class=\"wysiwyg-float-right\">A bit of background. Mozilla has always contributed to web standards, going back to the start of the project. We <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://brendaneich.com/2004/06/the-non-world-non-wide-non-web/\">co-founded</a> the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/\">WHAT-WG</a> to kick off <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html\">HTML5</a>. As readers of this blog know, we are a leader in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ecmascript.org/\">JS standardization</a>. We have some of the top <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dbaron.org/\">CSS</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://robert.ocallahan.org/\">layout</a> experts in the world.</p>\r\n<p>In the last eight months, our efforts to extend the web standards to include new APIs needed to build compelling apps and OS components on mobile devices have really caught fire. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G\">B2G</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Roadmap\">Open Web Apps</a> are the fuel for this fire.</p>\r\n<p>So I thought I would compile a list of emerging APIs to which we've contributed. In citing Mozillans I do not mean to minimize the efforts of standardization colleagues at Google, Microsoft, Nokia, Opera, the W3C and elsewhere. Standards are a multi-vendor effort (although excluding WebGL [see UPDATE below] one shiny name is conspicuously absent from this list).</p>\r\n<p>The Mozilla contributions are worth noting both to acknowledge the individuals involved, and to highlight how Mozilla is championing device APIs for the web without having a native application stack blessed with such APIs on offer. We see the Web as quickly evolving to match native stacks. We have no other agenda than improving the Web to improve its users' lives, including Web developers' lives -especially mobile users and developers.</p>\r\n<p>As always, standards in progress are subject to change, yet require prototype implementation and user-testing. Mozilla remains committed to playing fairly by not forging de-facto standards out of prototypes, rather proposing before disposing and in the end tracking whatever is standardized.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the list, starting with some 2011-era work:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html\">Geolocation</a>, with Google contributing the editor and Firefox (thanks to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/press/bios/#bio-sullivan\">Jay Sullivan</a> leading the charge) implementing early.</li>\r\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/\">WebGL</a> (UPDATE: Chris Marrin of Apple edited) and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/\">typed arrays</a>.</li>\r\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html\">Gamepad API</a>. Co-editor: Ted Mielczarek. Mozillans are also contributing to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerlock/raw-file/default/index.html\">Pointer Lock</a>.</li>\r\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/screen-orientation/raw-file/tip/Overview.html\">Screen Orientation</a>.

There's more to say, including about <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~afelt/\">bundled-permission follies</a> and how to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://robert.ocallahan.org/2011/06/permissions-for-web-applications_30.html\">weave</a> permission-granting (with memorization) into interactions, but not here.</p>\r\n<p>One last note. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-vendor-prefix-predicament-alas-eric-meyer-interviews-tantek-celik/\">CSS vendor prefix brouhaha</a> had, among many salutary effects, the benefit of shining light on an important requirement of competitive mobile web development: CSS style properties such as -webkit-animation-*, however you spell them, must have fast and beautiful implementations across devices for developers to find them usable: 60Hz, artifact-free rendering under touch control. This requires such work as <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/OffMainThreadCompositing\">off-main-thread compositing</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Layers\">GL layers</a>.</p>\r\n<p>This is a high technical bar, but we are in the process of meeting it in the latest Firefox for Android and B2G builds, thanks to hard work from many people, especially <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pcwalton.blogspot.com/\">Patrick Walton</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://robert.ocallahan.org/\">Robert O'Callahan</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.mozilla.com/cjones/\">Chris Jones</a>, and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://andreasgal.com/\">Andreas Gal</a>.

Whatever we can do to make the Django community a better place. Historically, this has mostly meant sponsoring sprints -- providing money for event catering and equipment hire, and where possible, to arrange for members of the core team to be present. The more financial contributions we have, the more activities we can sponsor.</p>\r\n<p>If you or your company is interested in becoming a corporate member, or if you have any questions about DSF membership, please <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/contact/foundation/\">get in touch using the DSF contact form</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If you have any questions about DSF membership, or if you have suggestions for what the DSF could do to help the community, get in touch, too!</p>\r\n<p>Posted by Russell Keith-Magee on January 16, 2012 at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/jan/16/dsf-membership-drive-2012/\">the Django Weblog</a></p>",

Lots of did-you-know and cool insight into how browsers work. 37 minutes long. I do discuss optional start and end tags as well as not quoting your attributes.

Always leave it up to tools to make your frontend payload smaller; you just want the most comfortable and maintainable authoring environment possible.</p>\r\n<p>I shared them in this talk because 1) it can lead to writing more beautiful HTML that is easier to maintain. Leaving off 's is a good example. 2) I just want people to consider browsers less of a black box of uncertainty. There are rules and specs that define behavior, so once understood you can feel confident relying on a consistent behavior. We certainly don't have that consistency across all the web platform, but for these examples you do.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, I'm not advocating you write more spartan markup if you don't want to. But if it makes you feel good, by all means, go at it; you know now how the browsers work.</p>\r\n<p>Original post: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://paulirish.com/2011/primitives-html5-video/\">http://paulirish.com/2011/primitives-html5-video/</a></p>",
